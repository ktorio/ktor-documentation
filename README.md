# Ktor Documentation

[![Official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

Welcome to the repository containing documentation of the [Ktor](https://ktor.io) framework, published
on [https://ktor.io/docs/](https://ktor.io/docs/).

## Project organization

This project is built with [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html) and has the
following project structure:

* `/cfg` contains configuration files.
* `/codeSnippets` contains a Gradle project with runnable code samples demonstrating Ktor
  capabilities. To learn how to run the samples and reference them in topics, see
  the [Code Snippets Doc](codeSnippets/README.md).
* `/images` contains images and GIFs used in topics.
* `/templates` has a single `settings.zip` file containing IntelliJ IDE settings.
* `/topics` contains documentation files in Markdown and XML.
* `ktor.tree` defines the table of contents.
* `c.list` contains a list of categories that define groups of related links for the 'See also' section of a topic.
* `v.list` contains a list of global project variables.
