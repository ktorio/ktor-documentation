# Serving OpenAPI
A sample project demonstrating how to serve [Swagger UI](https://ktor.io/docs/openapi-swagger.html) in Ktor.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running
To run this sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :json-kotlinx-openapi:run
```

Then, you can access the Swagger UI and OpenAPI endpoints:
- [http://localhost:8080/swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger)
- [http://localhost:8080/openapi](http://localhost:8080/openapi)
