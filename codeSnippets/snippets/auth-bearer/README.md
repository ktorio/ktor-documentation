# Bearer authentication
A sample project demonstrating how to use [bearer HTTP authentication](https://ktor.io/docs/bearer.html) in Ktor.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running
To run this sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :auth-bearer:run
```

Then, open the [get.http](get.http) file and make the `GET` request with a token sent using the `Bearer` scheme.
