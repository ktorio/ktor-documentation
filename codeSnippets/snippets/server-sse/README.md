# Server SSE

A sample Ktor project showing how to create a server using [SSE](https://ktor.io/docs/sse_server.html).
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

To run a sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :server-sse:run
```

Then, you can test the server using an [SSE client](../client-sse/README.md).

To start the SSE client, open a separate tab and execute the following command:

```bash
./gradlew :client-sse:run
```
