# Logging/Call logging

A sample Ktor project showing how to enable [Logging](https://ktor.io/docs/logging.html) in Ktor and use the [CallLogging](https://ktor.io/docs/call-logging.html) plugin to log incoming client requests.

## Running

To run a sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
