## Ktor Server

### Custom fallback for static resources

Ktor 3.3.0 introduces a new `fallback()` function for static content, allowing you to define custom
behavior when a requested resource is not found.

Unlike `default()`, which always serves the same fallback file, `fallback()` gives you access to the original requested
path and the current `ApplicationCall`. You can use this to redirect, return custom status codes, or serve different
files dynamically.

To define custom fallback behaviour, use the `fallback()` function within `staticFiles()`, `staticResources()`, `staticZip()`, or
`staticFileSystem()`:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/static-files/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt" include-lines="22,25-32,45"}


## Ktor Client

### Updated OkHttp version

In Ktor 3.3.0, the Ktor client's `OkHttp` engine has been upgraded to use OkHttp 5.1.0 (previously 4.12.0). This major
version bump may introduce API changes for projects that interact directly with OkHttp. Such projects should verify
compatibility.

## Shared

### Updated Jetty version

The Jetty server and client engines have been upgraded to use Jetty 12. For most applications, this upgrade is fully
backward-compatible, but client and server code now leverage the updated Jetty APIs internally.

If your project uses Jetty APIs directly, be aware that there are breaking changes. For more details, refer to
[the official Jetty migration guide](https://jetty.org/docs/jetty/12.1/programming-guide/migration/11-to-12.html).
