<link-summary>Learn how to prepare and deploy a Ktor application to Heroku.</link-summary>

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to prepare and deploy a Ktor application to Heroku.

## Prerequisites {id="prerequisites"}
Before starting this tutorial, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:
* You have a Heroku account.
* [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) is installed on your machine.


## Create a sample application {id="create-sample-app"}

Create a sample application as described in [](server_create_a_new_project.topic).

> Note that Ktor provides two approaches to [create and configure a server](create_server.topic): in code or by using a configuration file. The only difference in deploying is how to [specify a port](#port) used to listen for incoming requests.


## Prepare an application {id="prepare-app"}

### Step 1: Configure a port {id="port"}

First, you need to specify a port used to listen for incoming requests. Since Heroku uses the `PORT` environment variable, you need to configure the application to use a value of this variable. Depending on the way used to [configure a Ktor server](create_server.topic), do one of the following:
* If server configuration is specified in code, you can obtain the environment variable value using `System.getenv`. Open the `Application.kt` file placed in the `src/main/kotlin/com/example` folder and change the `port` parameter value of the `embeddedServer` function as shown below:
   ```kotlin
   fun main() {
      embeddedServer(Netty, port = System.getenv("PORT").toInt()) {
          // ...
      }.start(wait = true)
   }
    ```

* If your server configuration is specified in the `application.conf` file, you can assign the environment variable to the `port` parameter by using the `${ENV}` syntax. Open the `application.conf` file placed in `src/main/resources` and update it as shown below:
   ```
   ktor {
       deployment {
           port = 8080
           port = ${?PORT}
       }
   }
   ```
   {style="block"}

### Step 2: Add a stage task {id="stage"}
Open the `build.gradle.kts` file and add a custom `stage` task used by Heroku to make an executable that gets run on Heroku's platform:
```kotlin
tasks {
    create("stage").dependsOn("installDist")
}
``` 
Note that the `installDist` task comes with the Gradle [application plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html), which is already added to the sample project.

### Step 3: Create a Procfile {id="procfile"}
Create a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) in a project root and add the following content:
```
web: ./build/install/ktor-get-started-sample/bin/ktor-get-started-sample
```
{style="block"}

This file specifies a path to the application's executable generated by the [stage](#stage) task and allows Heroku to start the application.
You might need to replace `ktor-get-started-sample` with you project name.


## Deploy an application {id="deploy-app"}

To deploy the application to Heroku using Git, open the terminal and follow the steps below:

1. Commit changes made in the [previous section](#prepare-app) locally:
   ```Bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare app for deploying"
   ```
2. Login to Heroku CLI:
   ```Bash
   heroku login
   ```
3. Create a Heroku application using the `heroku create` command.
   You need to replace `ktor-sample-heroku` with a name of your application:
   ```Bash
   heroku create ktor-sample-heroku
   ```
   This command does two things:
   * Creates a new Heroku application, which is available on the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/).
   * Adds a new Git remote called `heroku` to a local repository.

4. To deploy the application, push changes to `heroku main`...
   ```Bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
   ... and wait until Heroku builds and publishes the application:
   ```
   ...
   remote: https://ktor-sample-heroku.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
   remote:
   remote: Verifying deploy... done.
   ```
