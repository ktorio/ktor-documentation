<link-summary>Learn how to create and configure a Ktor client.</link-summary>

After adding the [client dependencies](client-dependencies.md), you can instantiate the client by creating the [HttpClient](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client/-http-client/index.html) class instance and passing an [engine](client-engines.md) as a parameter:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/CioCreate.kt"}

In this example, we use the [CIO](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-cio/io.ktor.client.engine.cio/-c-i-o/index.html) engine.
You can also omit an engine:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/DefaultEngineCreate.kt"}

In this case, the client will choose an engine automatically depending on the artifacts [added in a build script](client-dependencies.md#engine-dependency). You can learn how the client chooses an engine from the [](client-engines.md#default) documentation section.

## Configure the client {id="configure-client"}

### Basic configuration {id="basic-config"}

To configure the client, you can pass an additional functional parameter to the client constructor. 
The [HttpClientConfig](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client/-http-client-config/index.html) class is a base class for configuring the client. 
For instance, you can enable [response validation](client-response-validation.md) using the `expectSuccess` property:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/BasicClientConfig.kt"}

### Engine configuration {id="engine-config"}
You can configure an engine using the `engine` function:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/BasicEngineConfig.kt"}

See the [Engines](client-engines.md) section for additional details.

### Plugins {id="plugins"}
To install a plugin, you need to pass it to the `install` function inside a [client configuration block](#configure-client). For example, you can log HTTP calls by installing the [Logging](client-logging.md) plugin:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/InstallLoggingPlugin.kt"}

You can also configure a plugin inside the `install` block. For example, for the [Logging](client-logging.md) plugin, you can specify the logger, logging level, and condition for filtering log messages:
```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/client-logging/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt" include-lines="13-22"}

Note that a specific plugin might require a separate [dependency](client-dependencies.md).

## Use the client {id="use-client"}
After you've [added](client-dependencies.md) all the required dependencies and created the client, you can use it to [make requests](client-requests.md) and [receive responses](client-responses.md). 


## Close the client {id="close-client"}

After you finish working with the HTTP client, you need to free up the resources: threads, connections, and `CoroutineScope` for coroutines. To do this, call the `HttpClient.close` function:

```kotlin
client.close()
```

Note that the `close` function prohibits creating new requests but doesn't terminate currently active ones. Resources will only be released after all client requests are completed.

If you need to use `HttpClient` for a single request, call the `use` function, which automatically calls `close` after executing the code block:

```kotlin
val status = HttpClient().use { client ->
    // ...
}
```

> Note that creating `HttpClient` is not a cheap operation, and it's better to reuse its instance in the case of multiple requests.
