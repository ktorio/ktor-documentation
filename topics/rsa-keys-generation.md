[RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is a widely used public-key
crypto-system that enables secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange.

RS256, part of the RSA encryption algorithm, utilizes SHA-256 for hashing and a key (usually
2048-bit, 4096-bit or higher) to secure digital communications.

In the realm of [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) authentication, RS256 plays a crucial role since the integrity and
authenticity of JWTs can be verified through signature mechanisms, such as RS256, where a public/private key pair is
employed. This ensures that the information contained within the token remains tamper-proof and trustworthy.

In this section you will learn how such keys are generated and used alongside the [Authentication JWT](server-jwt.md)
plugin provided by Ktor.

<warning>
<p>
For production use, it is recommended that you choose a more modern alternative, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ES256</a>, that's based on more efficient, and secure cryptography compared to RSA.

## Generating an RSA private key

To generate a private key, you can use OpenSSL, `ssh-keygen` or another tool of your choice for creating authentication
key pairs. For demonstration purposes, OpenSSL will be used.

In a new terminal window, run the following command:

<code-block lang="shell">
openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 &gt; ktor.pk8
</code-block>

The [openssl genpkey](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-genpkey.html) command generates a private
2048-bit key using the RSA algorithm and stores it in the specified file, here `ktor.pk8`. The content of the file
is [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded and thus, needs to be decoded before the public key can be
derived.

> To use the private key from the
> [code example](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-documentation/blob/%ktor_version%/codeSnippets/snippets/auth-jwt-rs256/)
> , navigate to the `application.conf` file within `src/main/resources` and extract the private key to a
> new `.pk8` file.

## Deriving the public key {id="second-step"}

In order to derive the public key from your previously generated private key, you will need to perform
the following steps:

1. Decode the private key.
2. Extract the public key.
3. Save the public key in PEM format.

To do this with OpenSSL, run the following command:

<code-block lang="shell">
openssl rsa -in ktor.pk8 -pubout | tee ktor.spki
</code-block>

* `openssl rsa`: This is the `OpenSSL` command for working with RSA keys. In this context, it is used to perform
  operations related to RSA keys.
* `-in ktor.pk8`: This option specifies the input file (`ktor.pk8`) from which OpenSSL should read the RSA private key.
* `-pubout`: This option instructs OpenSSL to output the public key corresponding to the private key provided in the
  input file.
* `|`: The pipe (|) symbol is used to redirect the output of the previous command (the public key generated by openssl
  rsa) to the tee command.
* `tee ktor.spki`: `tee` is a command-line utility that reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and
  one or more files. This part of the command instructs tee to write the received input to a file named `ktor.spki`. So,
  the public key will be both displayed on the terminal and saved in the `ktor.spki` file.

With the public key at hand, you can now derive its exponent and modulus values.

## Extracting the modulus & exponent attributes

Now that you have your key-pair, you need to extract the `e` (exponent) and `n` (modulus) attributes of your
public key, in order to use them in your `jwks.json` file. This requires the following steps:

1. Read the public key from the `.spki` file you created.
2. Display information about the key in a human-readable format.

To do this using OpenSSL, run the following command:

<code-block lang="shell">
openssl pkey -in ktor.spki -pubin -noout -text
</code-block>

* `pkey`: This is the OpenSSL command-line utility for processing private and public keys.
* `-in ktor.spki`: Specifies the input file containing the public key in PEM format. In this case, the input file is
  `ktor.spki`.
* `-pubin`: Indicates that the input file contains a public key. Without this option, OpenSSL would assume that the
  input file contains a private key.
* `-noout`: This option prevents OpenSSL from outputting the encoded public key. The command will only display
  information about the public key, and the actual key won't be printed to the console.
* `-text`: Requests that OpenSSL display the textual representation of the key. This includes details such as the key
  type, size, and the actual key data in human-readable form.

The expected output looks like this:

```Shell
$ openssl pkey -in ktor.spki -pubin -noout -text
RSA Public-Key: (512 bit)
Modulus:
    00:b5:f2:5a:2e:bc:d7:20:b5:20:d5:4d:cd:d4:a5:
    7c:c8:9a:fd:d8:61:e7:e4:eb:58:65:1e:ea:5a:4d:
    4c:73:87:32:e0:91:a3:92:56:2e:a7:bc:1e:32:30:
    43:f5:fd:db:05:5a:08:b2:25:15:5f:ac:4d:71:82:
    2b:d0:87:b4:01
Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)
```

<warning>
<p>
Note that in this example the public key uses 512-bit, which is not secure. Ideally, you should
opt for 2048-bit or 4096-bit keys.
</p>
</warning>

## Converting and encoding the modulus and exponent attributes

In the previous step you extracted the `n` and `e` attributes needed for your `jwks.json` file. However, they are in
hexadecimal format. You now need to convert the hexadecimal representation of the exponent and modulus to their
respective [Base64URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications) encodings.

### Exponent

The exponent attribute has a HEX value of `0x10001`. To convert the value to Base64URL, use the following command:

<code-block lang="shell">
echo 010001 | xxd -p -r | base64 
</code-block>

* `echo 010001`: This part of the command uses the `echo` command to output the string "010001", which represents the
  public exponent (e) of the RSA key, to the standard output.
* `|`: The `|` character is a pipe that takes the output from the preceding command and passes it as input to the
  following command.
* `xxd -p -r`: This command is used to convert hexadecimal to binary. It takes the hexadecimal input and produces the
  corresponding binary output.
* `| base64`: This part of the command takes the binary output from the previous step and encodes it in Base64 format
  using the `base64` command.

<note>
<p>
Note that an even number of HEX digits was used by adding an extra 0 to the left.
</p>
</note>

This is the expected output for the aforementioned exponent value:

```Shell
$ echo 010001 | xxd -p -r | base64
AQAB
```

The Base64URL encoded value of the exponent is `AQAB` and does not require further processing for this case. In other
cases, you may need to use the `tr` command as shown in the next step.

### Modulus

For the `n` attribute, you will use the `tr` utility to further process
the hexadecimal representation of the modulus.


<code-block lang="shell">
echo "b5:f2:5a:2e:bc:d7:20:b5:20:d5:4d:cd:d4:a5:
    7c:c8:9a:fd:d8:61:e7:e4:eb:58:65:1e:ea:5a:4d:
    4c:73:87:32:e0:91:a3:92:56:2e:a7:bc:1e:32:30:
    43:f5:fd:db:05:5a:08:b2:25:15:5f:ac:4d:71:82:
    2b:d0:87:b4:01" | tr -d ": \n" | xxd -p -r | base64 | tr +/ -_ | tr -d "=\n"
</code-block>

<note>
<p>
Note that the leading 00 byte has been omitted. The leading 00 byte in the modulus is related to the ASN.1 encoding of the RSA public key. In the ASN.1 DER encoding of integers, the leading zero byte is removed if the most significant bit of the integer is 0. This is a standard part of ASN.1 encoding rules.
In the context of RSA public keys, the modulus is a big-endian integer, and when represented in DER encoding, it follows these rules. The removal of the leading zero byte is done to ensure that the integer is interpreted correctly according to the DER rules.
</p>
</note>

* `echo "b5:f2:5a:2e:bc:d7:20:b5:20:d5:4d:cd:d4:a5: \ ... "`: This part of the command echoes a multi-line hexadecimal
  string, representing a series of bytes. The backslashes at the end of each line indicate line continuation.
* `tr -d ": \n"`: The `tr` command is used to delete characters specified in the argument list.
  Here, it removes colons, spaces, and newline characters from the hexadecimal string, making it a continuous string of
  hex digits.
* `xxd -p -r`: `xxd` is a utility for creating a hex dump of a binary file or converting a hex dump back to binary.
  The `-p` option specifies plain hexdump without line number or ASCII character columns.
  The `-r` option reverses the operation, converting hex back to binary.
* `base64`: Encodes the binary output from the previous step into Base64 format.
* `tr +/ -_`: Translates the + and / characters in the Base64 output to - and _, respectively. This is a common
  modification for URL-safe Base64 encoding.
* `tr -d "=\n"`: Removes any equal signs (=) and newline characters from the final Base64-encoded string.

The output of the above command is:

```Shell
$ echo "b5:f2:5a:2e:bc:d7:20:b5:20:d5:4d:cd:d4:a5:
    7c:c8:9a:fd:d8:61:e7:e4:eb:58:65:1e:ea:5a:4d:
    4c:73:87:32:e0:91:a3:92:56:2e:a7:bc:1e:32:30:
    43:f5:fd:db:05:5a:08:b2:25:15:5f:ac:4d:71:82:
    2b:d0:87:b4:01" | tr -d ": \n" | xxd -p -r | base64 | tr +/ -_ | tr -d "=\n"
tfJaLrzXILUg1U3N1KV8yJr92GHn5OtYZR7qWk1Mc4cy4JGjklYup7weMjBD9f3bBVoIsiUVX6xNcYIr0Ie0AQ
```

By leveraging the `tr` command properly, the modulus field has been encoded into a Base64URL string that you can use in
your `jwks.json` file.

## Populating the jwks.json file

In the previous steps, you gathered the following necessary information:

1. An RSA key-pair.
2. The modulus of the RSA public key in Base64URL format.
3. The exponent of the RSA public key in Base64URL format.

With these at hand, you can now populate
the [jwks.json](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets) file of your Ktor project with
the following attributes:

- The `e` and `n` values with the Base64URL encoded values you produced in the previous steps.
- A key id (in this case, the `kid` is derived from the sample project).
- The `kty` attribute as `RSA`.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "kid": "6f8856ed-9189-488f-9011-0ff4b6c08edc",
      "n":"tfJaLrzXILUg1U3N1KV8yJr92GHn5OtYZR7qWk1Mc4cy4JGjklYup7weMjBD9f3bBVoIsiUVX6xNcYIr0Ie0AQ"
    }
  ]
}
```

The only remaining step is to specify your private key so that your Ktor project can use it for authentication.

## Defining the private key

With your public key information set up, the last step is to provide your Ktor project with access to your private key.

Assuming that you have extracted your private key (which you generated at the beginning in your `.pk8` file) into an
environment variable on your system, called `jwt_pk` in this case, your `resources/application.conf` file's jwt section
should look similar to:

```
jwt {
  privateKey = ${jwt_pk}
  issuer = "http://0.0.0.0:8080/"
  audience = "http://0.0.0.0:8080/login"
  realm = "MyProject"
}
```

<warning>
<p>
Your private key is considered sensitive information and should not be stored directly in code. Consider using environment variables or a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html">secret store</a> for sensitive data.
