Ktor is a framework to easily build connected applications – web applications, HTTP services, mobile and browser applications.
Modern connected applications need to be asynchronous to provide the best experience to users, and Kotlin coroutines provide
awesome facilities to do it in an easy and straightforward way.

While not yet entirely there, the goal of Ktor is to provide an end-to-end multiplatform application framework for connected applications.
Currently, JVM client and server scenarios are supported, as well as JavaScript, iOS and Android clients, and we are working on bringing server facilities to native
environments, and client facilities to other native targets.
