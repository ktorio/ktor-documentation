Learn how to receive responses, get a response body and obtain response parameters.
</link-summary>

All functions used to [make an HTTP request](client-requests.md) (`request`, `get`, `post`, etc.) allow you to receive a
response as
an [`HttpResponse`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.statement/-http-response/index.html)
object.

`HttpResponse` exposes the API required to get a [response body](#body) in various ways (raw bytes, JSON
objects, etc.) and obtain [response parameters](#parameters), such as a status code, content type, and headers.
For example, you can receive `HttpResponse` for a `GET` request without parameters in the following way:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/client-configure-request/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt" include-lines="21"}

## Receive response parameters {id="parameters"}

The [`HttpResponse`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.statement/-http-response/index.html)
class allows you to get various response parameters, such as a status code, headers, HTTP version, and more.

### Status code {id="status"}

To get the status code of a response, use the
[`HttpResponse.status`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.statement/-http-response/status.html)
property:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/_misc_client/ResponseTypes.kt" include-lines="1-4,9,11,15-17"}

### Headers {id="headers"}

The [
`HttpResponse.headers`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.statement/-http-response/index.html)
property allows you to get a [Headers](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-http/io.ktor.http/-headers/index.html) map containing
all response headers. Additionally, `HttpResponse` exposes the following functions for receiving specific header values:

* `contentType` for the `Content-Type` header value
* `charset` for a charset from the `Content-Type` header value.
* `etag` for the `E-Tag` header value.
* `setCookie` for the `Set-Cookie` header value.
  > Ktor also provides the [HttpCookies](client-cookies.md) plugin that allows you to keep cookies between calls.


## Receive response body {id="body"}

### Raw body {id="raw"}

To receive a raw body of a response, call the `body` function and pass the required type as a parameter. The code
snippet below shows how to receive a raw body as a [`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/):

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/ResponseTypes.kt" include-lines="11,12"}

Similarly, you can get a body as a [`ByteArray`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-byte-array/):

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/_misc_client/ResponseTypes.kt" include-lines="11,13"}

A [runnable example](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-documentation/tree/%ktor_version%/codeSnippets/snippets/client-download-file)
below shows how to get a response as a `ByteArray` and save it to a file:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/client-download-file/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Downloader.kt" include-lines="12-24"}

The [`onDownload()`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.plugins/on-download.html) extension
function in the example above is used to display download progress.

This approach loads the entire response into memory at once, which can be problematic for large files. To reduce memory
usage, consider [streaming the data](#streaming) in chunks.

### JSON object {id="json"}

With the [ContentNegotiation](client-serialization.md) plugin installed, you can deserialize JSON data into a data class
when receiving responses:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/client-json-kotlinx/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt" include-lines="39"}

To learn more, see [](client-serialization.md#receive_send_data).

> The ContentNegotiation plugin is available for both the [client](client-serialization.md) and
> the [server](server-serialization.md). Ensure to use the proper one for your case.

### Streaming data {id="streaming"}

When you call the `HttpResponse.body` function to get a body, Ktor processes a response in memory and returns a full
response body. If you need to get chunks of a response sequentially instead of waiting for the entire response, use
`HttpStatement` with
scoped [execute](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-client/ktor-client-core/io.ktor.client.statement/-http-statement/execute.html)
block.
A [runnable example](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-documentation/tree/%ktor_version%/codeSnippets/snippets/client-download-streaming)
below shows how to receive a response content in chunks (byte packets) and save them in a file:

```kotlin
```
{src="snippets/client-download-streaming/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt" include-lines="15-36"}

In this example, [`ByteReadChannel`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-io/io.ktor.utils.io/-byte-read-channel/index.html) is used
to read data asynchronously. Using `ByteReadChannel.readRemaining()` retrieves all available bytes in the channel, while
`Source.transferTo()` directly writes the data to the file, reducing unnecessary allocations.

To save a response body to a file without extra processing, you can use the
[`ByteReadChannel.copyAndClose()`](https://api.ktor.io/ktor-io/io.ktor.utils.io/copy-and-close.html) function instead:

```Kotlin
client.prepareGet("https://httpbin.org/bytes/$fileSize").execute { httpResponse ->
    val channel: ByteReadChannel = httpResponse.body()
    channel.copyAndClose(file.writeChannel())
    println("A file saved to ${file.path}")
}
```
