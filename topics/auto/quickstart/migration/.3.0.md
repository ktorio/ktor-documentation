Published 14 Jan 202 (`1.3.0`)

## Version bumps:
* Kotlin `1.3.50` -> `1.3.61`
* kotlinx.coroutines `1.3.0` -> `1.3.3`
* Dropwizard: `3.2.4` -> `4.1.0`
* Tomcat: `9.0.10` -> `9.0.29`
* Jetty: `9.4.22.v20191022` -> `9.4.24.v20191120`
* Netty: `4.1.37.Final` -> `4.1.43.Final`
* kotlinx.io -> `0.1.14` -> none

## Breaking changes:
* kotlinx.io dependency has been removed, replace imports:
    * `import kotlinx.io.` -> `import io.ktor.utils.io.`
    * `import kotlinx.coroutines.io.` -> `import io.ktor.utils.io.`
* No binary compatibility with 1.2.x.
* Incompatible Gradle metadata version (requires 5.4.1+ for MPP).
* It was dangerous to forget call `HttpResponse.close`, so we cleaned it's API:
    - `HttpResponse` isn't `Closeable` anymore: no need to close it, no resource leaks
    - `HttpResponse` is in-memory by default
    - Introduced `HttpStatement`: new primitive for streaming and partial load
      - To learn more details follow client [Quick start guide](/clients/http-client/quick-start/streaming.html)
* Web socket session `send` function now throws `CancellationException` instead of `ClosedSendChannelException`.

## Known issues:
* Netty HTTP/2 push sometimes get rejected
* Running iOS and native clients on non-main worker is still not supported
* JS engine may trigger CORS preflight ([#1533](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/issues/1533))
