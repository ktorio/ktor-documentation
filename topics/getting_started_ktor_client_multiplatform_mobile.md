Learn how to create a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile application.
</link-summary>

The Ktor HTTP client can be used in multiplatform projects. In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Kotlin Multiplatform
Mobile application, which sends a request and receives a response body as plain HTML text.

> To learn how to create your first Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile application,
see [Create your first cross-platform mobile app](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-create-first-app.html).

## Prerequisites {id="prerequisites"}

First, you need to set up an environment for cross-platform mobile development by installing the necessary tools on a
suitable operating system. Learn how to do this from
the [Set up an environment](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-setup.html) section.

> You will need a Mac with macOS to complete certain steps in this tutorial, which include writing iOS-specific code and
running an iOS application.

## Create a new project {id="new-project"}

To start a new Kotlin Multiplatform project, there are two approaches available:

- You can create a project from a template within Android Studio.
- Alternatively, you can use the [Kotlin Multiplatform Wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com/) to generate a new project.
  The wizard provides options for customizing your project setup, allowing you to exclude Android support
  or include a Ktor Server, for instance.

For the sake of this tutorial, we will demonstrate the process of creating a project from a template:

1. In Android Studio, select **File | New | New Project**.
2. Select **Kotlin Multiplatform App** in the list of project templates, and click **Next**.
3. Specify a name for your application, and click **Next**. In our tutorial, the application name is `KmmKtor`.
4. On the next page, leave the default settings and click **Finish** to create a new project.
   Now, wait while your project is set up. It may take some time to download and set up the required components when you
   do this for the first time.
   > To view the complete structure of the generated multiplatform project, switch from **Android** to **Project** in
   a [Project view](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects#ProjectView).

## Configure build scripts {id="build-script"}

### Update Kotlin Gradle plugins {id="update_gradle_plugins"}

Open the `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file and update the Kotlin version to the latest:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/gradle/libs.versions.toml" include-lines="3"}

<include from="http-client_engines.md" element-id="newmm-note"/>

### Add Ktor dependencies {id="ktor-dependencies"}

To use the Ktor HTTP client in your project, you need to add at least two dependencies: a client dependency and an
engine dependency.

In the `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file add the Ktor version:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/gradle/libs.versions.toml" include-lines="1,5"}

<include from="getting_started_ktor_client.topic" element-id="eap-note"/>

Then, define the Ktor client and engine libraries:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/gradle/libs.versions.toml" include-lines="11,19-21"}

To add the dependencies, open the `shared/build.gradle.kts` file and follow the steps below:

1. To use the Ktor client in common code, add the dependency `ktor-client-core` to the `commonMain` source set:
   ```kotlin
   ```
   {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/shared/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="26-28,30,40"}

2. Add an [engine dependency](http-client_engines.md) for each required platform to the corresponding source set:
    - For Android, add the `ktor-client-okhttp` dependency to the `androidMain` source set:
      ```kotlin
      ```
      {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/shared/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="34-36"}

      For Android, you can also use [other engine types](http-client_engines.md#jvm-android).
    - For iOS, add the `ktor-client-darwin` dependency to `iosMain`:
      ```kotlin
      ```
      {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/shared/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="37-39"}

### Add coroutines {id="coroutines"}

To use coroutines in [Android code](#android-activity), you need to add `kotlinx.coroutines` to your project:

1. Open the `gradle/libs.versions.toml` file and specify the kotlinx version and libraries:

    ```kotlin
    ```
   {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/gradle/libs.versions.toml" include-lines="1,4,10-11,22-23"}

2. Open the `build.gradle.kts` file and add the `kotlinx-coroutines-core` dependency to the `commonMain` source set:

    ```kotlin
    ```
   {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/shared/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="26-30,40"}

3. Then, open the `androidApp/build.gradle.kts` and add the `kotlinx-coroutines-android` dependency:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/androidApp/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="41,47,49"}

Click **Sync Now** in the top right corner of the `gradle.properties` file to install the added dependencies.

## Update your application {id="code"}

### Shared code {id="shared-code"}

To update code shared between Android and iOS, open the `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/example/kmmktor/Greeting.kt`
file and add the following code to the `Greeting` class:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/example/kmmktor/Greeting.kt"}

- To create the HTTP client, the `HttpClient` constructor is called.
- The suspending `greeting` function is used to make a [request](request.md) and receive the body of
  a [response](response.md) as a string value.

### Android code {id="android-activity"}

To call the suspending `greeting` function from the Android code, we'll be
using [rememberCoroutineScope](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#rememberCoroutineScope(kotlin.Function0)).

Open the `androidApp/src/main/java/com/example/kmmktor/android/MainActivity.kt` file and update `MainActivity` code as
follows:

```kotlin
```

{src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/androidApp/src/main/java/com/example/kmmktor/android/MainActivity.kt"}

Inside the created scope, we can call the shared `greeting` function and handle possible exceptions.

### iOS code {id="ios-view"}

1. Open the `iosApp/iosApp/iOSApp.swift` file and update the entry point for the application:
   ```Swift
   ```
   {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/iosApp/iosApp/iOSApp.swift"}

2. Open the `iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift` file and update `ContentView` code in the following way:
   ```Swift
   ```
   {src="snippets/tutorial-client-kmm/iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift"}

   On iOS, the `greeting` suspending function is available as a function with a callback.

## Enable internet access on Android {id="android-internet"}

The final thing we need to do is to enable internet access for the Android application.
Open the `androidApp/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and enable the required permission using the `uses-permission`
element:

```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest> 
```

## Run your application {id="run"}

To run the created multiplatform application on the Android or iOS simulator, select **androidApp** or **iosApp** and
click **Run**.
The simulator should display the received HTML document as plain text.
