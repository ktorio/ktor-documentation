[//]: # (title: Building Ktor)

<include src="lib.md" include-id="outdated_warning"/>

Ktor is an OpenSource project hosted at GitHub:
<https://github.com/ktorio/ktor>

Release versions are available at maven central.

We usually provide nightly builds at jetbrains.space:
<https://ktor.io/eap>

## Downloading the source
{id="get-git-sources"}

You can get the latest version of Ktor using git to clone Ktor's repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/ktorio/ktor.git
cd ktor
```

## Building {id="building"}

Ktor uses gradle for building. It should work with any gradle version
greater than 4.3, but for best results we provide a gradle wrapper,
which should work with any supported system with a JDK installed: 

```text
./gradlew build
```

## Installing locally {id="installing"}

Ktor provides a gradle install task that installs Ktor artifacts in your
local maven repository:

```text
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

## Troubleshooting {id="troubleshooting"}

If you get an error similar to:

```text
* Where:
Build file '/.../ktor/ktor-server/ktor-server-benchmarks/build.gradle' line: 2

* What went wrong:
An exception occurred applying plugin request [id: 'me.champeau.gradle.jmh', version: '0.4.4']
> Failed to apply plugin [id 'me.champeau.gradle.jmh']
   > Could not generate a proxy class for class me.champeau.gradle.JMHPluginExtension.
```

You might have forgotten to use the gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`), or your default installed
gradle version is lower than 4.3.

Always use the gradle wrapper for consistent results!
