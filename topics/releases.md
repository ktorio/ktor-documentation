[//]: # (title: Ktor releases)

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="2"/>

Ktor follows semantic versioning:

- _Major versions_ (1.0, 2.0, and so on) can contain incompatible API changes.
- _Minor versions_ (2.1, 2.2, and so on) can provide backward-compatible functionality.
- _Patch versions_ (2.2.1, 2.2.2, and so on) can add backward-compatible fixes.

You can find all Ktor releases on GitHub: [Releases](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/releases).

For each major and minor release, we also ship several preview (EAP) versions for you to try new features before they are released. See [Early Access Program](https://ktor.io/eap/) for details.


## Gradle plugin {id="gradle"}

The [Gradle Ktor plugin](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-build-plugins) and the framework are in the same release cycle.
You can find all plugin releases on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.ktor.plugin).


## IntelliJ Ultimate plugin {id="intellij"}

The [IntelliJ Ktor plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ktor.html) is released independently of the Ktor framework and 
uses the same release cycle as [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html).


### Update to a new release {id="update"}

The IntelliJ Ktor plugin allows you to migrate your Ktor project to the latest version.
You can learn more from the [Migrate projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ktor.html#migrate) section.
