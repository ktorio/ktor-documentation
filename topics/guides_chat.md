[//]: # (title: Chat)

<include src="lib.md" include-id="outdated_warning"/>

In this tutorial, you will learn how to make a Chat application using Ktor.
We are going to use WebSockets for a real-time bidirectional communication.

To achieve this, we are going to use the [Routing], [WebSockets] and [Sessions] features.

[Routing]: Routing_in_Ktor.md
[WebSockets]: websocket.md
[Sessions]: sessions.md

This is an advanced tutorial and it assumes you have some basic knowledge about Ktor,
so you should follow the [guide about making a Website](website.md) first.





## Setting up the project

The first step is to set up a project. You can follow the [Quick Start](Welcome.md) guide,
or use the following form to create one:



## Understanding WebSockets

WebSockets is a subprotocol of HTTP. It starts as a normal HTTP request with an upgrade request header,
and the connection switches to be a bidirectional communication instead of a request response one.

The smallest unit of transmission that can be sent as part of the WebSocket protocol, is a `Frame`. A WebSocket Frame defines a type, a length and a payload that might be binary or text.
Internally those frames might be transparently sent in several TCP packets. 

You can see Frames as WebSocket messages. Frames could be the following types: text, binary, close, ping and pong.

You will normally handle `Text` and `Binary` frames, and the other will be handled by Ktor in most of the cases
(though you can use a raw mode where you can handle those extra frame types yourself).

You can read more about this in the [WebSockets feature documentation](websocket.md).  

## WebSocket route

This first step is to create a route for the WebSocket. In this case we are going to define the `/chat` route,
but initially, we are going to make that route to act as an "echo" WebSocket route, that will send you back the same text messages that you send to it.

`webSocket` routes are intended to be long-lived. Since it is a suspend block and uses lightweight Kotlin coroutines,
it is fine and you can handle (depending on the machine and the complexity) hundreds of thousands of connections
at once, while keeping your code easy to read and to write.

```kotlin
routing {
    webSocket("/chat") { // this: DefaultWebSocketSession
        while (true) {
            val frame = incoming.receive() // suspend
            when (frame) {
                is Frame.Text -> {
                    val text = frame.readText()
                    outgoing.send(Frame.Text(text)) // suspend
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Keeping a set of opened connections

We can use a Set to keep a list of opened connections. We can use a plain `try...finally` to keep track of them.
Since Ktor is multithreaded by default we should use thread-safe collections or [limit the body to a single thread with newSingleThreadContext](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/coroutines-guide.md#coroutine-context-and-dispatchers){target="_blank"}. 

```kotlin
routing {
    val wsConnections = Collections.synchronizedSet(LinkedHashSet<DefaultWebSocketSession>())
    
    webSocket("/chat") { // this: DefaultWebSocketSession
        wsConnections += this
        try {
            while (true) {
                val frame = incoming.receive()
                // ...
            }
        } finally {
            wsConnections -= this
        }
    }
}
```

## Propagating a message among all the connections

Now that we have a set of connections, we can iterate over them and use the session
to send the frames we need.
Everytime a user sends a message, we are going to propagate to all the connected clients.

```kotlin
routing {
    val wsConnections = Collections.synchronizedSet(LinkedHashSet<DefaultWebSocketSession>())
    
    webSocket("/chat") { // this: DefaultWebSocketSession
        wsConnections += this
        try {
            while (true) {
                val frame = incoming.receive()
                when (frame) {
                    is Frame.Text -> {
                        val text = frame.readText()
                        // Iterate over all the connections
                        for (conn in wsConnections) {
                            conn.outgoing.send(Frame.Text(text))
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
            wsConnections -= this
        }
    }
}
```

## Assigning names to users/connections

We might want to associate some information, like a name to an opened connection,
we can create an object that includes the WebSocketSession and store it instead
like this:

```kotlin
class ChatClient(val session: DefaultWebSocketSession) {
    companion object { var lastId = AtomicInteger(0) }
    val id = lastId.getAndIncrement()
    val name = "user$id"
}

routing {
    val clients = Collections.synchronizedSet(LinkedHashSet<ChatClient>())
    
    webSocket("/chat") { // this: DefaultWebSocketSession
        val client = ChatClient(this)
        clients += client
        try {
            while (true) {
                val frame = incoming.receive()
                when (frame) {
                    is Frame.Text -> {
                        val text = frame.readText()
                        // Iterate over all the connections
                        val textToSend = "${client.name} said: $text"
                        for (other in clients.toList()) {
                            other.session.outgoing.send(Frame.Text(textToSend))
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } finally {
            clients -= client
        }
    }
}
```
